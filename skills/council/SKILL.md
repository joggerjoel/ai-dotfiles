name: council
description: Convene an adversarial "council" to audit an engineering plan, spec, or design doc BEFORE any code is written. Runs a fixed set of lenses (architecture, red-team, security, cost-metering, reliability, code-quality, provisioning/bill-of-materials, devil's-advocate), each emitting structured YAML findings, then machine-merges them into a single ranked consensus — dedupe by id, group by root cause, consensus scoring, and an anti-herd counter-argument when every reviewer agrees. Use when the user says "council review", "counsel-council", "convene the council", "review/audit this plan or spec", "red-team this design", or otherwise wants a hardened pre-implementation review of a plan, spec, or design document.

# Council review

An adversarial, multi-lens audit of an engineering **document** (implementation plan / spec /
design doc) **before code is written**. The council runs 8 lenses over the document, each a
cold reader that trusts nothing the doc claims about itself, then merges every lens's structured
findings into one ranked consensus. The full reviewer prompt and orchestrator config live in
`references/reviewer-contract.md` — read it before running.

## Step 0 — SOURCE precondition (never skip)

You must have the **document text**, not just a path. If the file is readable, read it now. If
you have only a filename you cannot open and nothing was pasted, **stop** and ask for the text —
do not invent findings. This mirrors the contract's `source_status: none` branch.

Compute a `source_fingerprint` (first 6 words … last 6 words) once, up front. Every lens must
review the _same_ text — reject any merge where fingerprints disagree (`version_guard`).

**Isolate pre-loop (recommended):** before convening 8 lenses, run the document through
`isolate` (`bin/isolate` — cold, zero-context single reviewer), fix what it finds, and repeat
**until a pass returns no new material findings** — convergence is the exit condition, not a
round count (typically 2–3 rounds; cap at 5 as a backstop). Each round is one model call; the
council's dedupe and consensus scoring then spend their budget on hard structural defects
instead of noise. After the council's fixes are written back, run the same isolate loop to
convergence again — fixes are new text from a context-loaded author and need fresh eyes too.

## Step 1 — pick the execution mode

Three tiers, best first. Default to the best one available in the current environment.

1. **Parallel subagents (default in a Claude Code session).** Dispatch one subagent per lens
   with the Agent tool (`subagent_type: general-purpose`), all in a single message so they run
   concurrently. Each gets: the full document text, the reviewer prompt from
   `references/reviewer-contract.md` Part A, and its assigned `LENS`. Structured 8-lens coverage
   with process isolation; reviewers are all Claude, so blind spots are partially correlated —
   the anti-herd step below compensates.
2. **Fleet multi-model (highest diversity).** Use only when the user is driving this from the
   aorus CLI adapters. Route each lens to a distinct provider per `references/reviewer-contract.md`
   Part B (`routing:` block), run across the `hosts:`, collect each YAML. A single chat cannot
   orchestrate this — describe it, hand over the per-lens prompts, or drive it via Bash if the
   adapters are on PATH. Do not fake diversity by relabeling one model as five.
3. **Single-model six-hats (fallback).** No subagents available → run Part A yourself once with
   `LENS: all`, producing one YAML with findings from every lens. Cheapest; least diverse.

State which tier you used so the user knows the diversity level of the result.

## Step 2 — run the lenses

The 8 lenses (see the contract for each one's exact mandate):
`architecture`, `red_team`, `security`, `cost_metering`, `reliability`, `code_quality`,
`provisioning`, `devils_advocate`.

Each reviewer must:

- Trace every link (import→definition, constant→use, "Consumes X"→"Produces X", units end-to-end).
  A missing or mismatched link is a finding.
- Stay inside the document's text — except `provisioning`, the one lens allowed to bring
  ecosystem knowledge (implicit model backbones, dataset/license needs); it marks such findings
  `[ecosystem]` and anchors them to the snippet that implies the dependency.
- Anchor every finding to a **task/section id + a verbatim quoted snippet** (that quote is what
  makes two reviewers' findings mergeable).
- Use the exact `severity` rubric and `confidence` (0-100) anchors from the contract.
- Emit **YAML only**, exactly the contract's schema. A lens that finds nothing emits `findings: []`
  — never filler.

## Step 3 — merge into consensus

Collect every lens's YAML, then:

- **Dedupe** by finding `id` (stable kebab slug) — the same defect found by N reviewers collapses
  to one entry that records how many distinct reviewers/models raised it.
- **Group** by `root_cause_group` so N symptoms of one underlying cause read as one root cause.
- **Score** each merged finding: `severity_weight × mean(confidence) × count(distinct reviewers)`.
  Rank most-severe / highest-consensus first.
- **Anti-herd:** if _every_ reviewer agreed on a finding, you must attach at least one concrete
  counter-argument (why it might NOT be a defect) before accepting it — unanimity is a smell, not
  a proof.
- **Version guard:** drop any lens whose `source_fingerprint` differs from Step 0's — it reviewed
  a stale copy.

## Step 4 — emit the report

Output the ranked consensus: for each finding, its id, title, severity, consensus score, how many
reviewers raised it, the anchoring task+snippet, the concrete failure, and the one-line fix —
root causes grouped. Lead with `critical`/`high`. Do not soften. If the council found nothing at a
given severity, say so plainly rather than padding.

Then offer next steps: feed the criticals back into the plan, or (if the user wants) open the doc
and apply the fixes.

## Reference

- `references/reviewer-contract.md` — the verbatim reviewer prompt (Part A) + orchestrator/routing
  config (Part B). This is the source of truth for lens mandates, the severity/confidence rubrics,
  and the output schema. When in doubt, follow the contract over this summary.
